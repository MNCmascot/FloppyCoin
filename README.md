# FloppyCoin

Floppy Coin is a game created using pygame. You are a coin, and your objective is to jump through as many coin slots as you can (endlessly) until you miss one.

Try to get some of the powerups!

To play the game, make sure you have all the files, and then run the python code.

Don't forget to install pygame.
